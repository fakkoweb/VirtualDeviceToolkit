 * Class to handle the online mean and variance using the Knuth/Welford algorithm

def online_variance(data):
    n = 0
    mean = 0
    M2 = 0
    for x in data:
        n = n + 1
        delta = x - mean
        mean = mean + delta/n
        M2 = M2 + delta*(x - mean)
    variance = M2/(n - 1)
    return variance

This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to massive cancellation,
but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop.
 * In our case it's interesting to calculate mean and variance online for a most efficient
 * algorithm it's
